Official VAIC 64W Programming repo for the 2020-2021 Season

**What is VAIC?**

VAIC is a robotics competition held by Vex Robotics in which 4 fully autonomous robots compete for points in the season's game.  This season's game is called *Change Up*.

Our team's challenge this year is to create two robots capable of playing *Change Up* together **without the help of a driver**.  This means we will be designing an AI capable of processing sensor data, creating a list of moves, weighing its options, and executing a move in order to maximize points scored.

**How can I support this team?**

We have a GoFundMe!  Our school cannot afford the registration fee for this year.  Any donation would be appreciated.
